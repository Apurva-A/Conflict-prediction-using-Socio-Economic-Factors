## Predicting Conflicts with Socio-Economic Factors

This project investigates the potential of socio-economic factors to predict conflicts in countries around the world. 

**Motivation**

The human cost of conflict is devastating. By analyzing historical data and various socio-economic factors, this project aims to develop insights that can help policymakers and organizations identify and address potential conflicts before they erupt.

**Research Questions**

* How can we understand the progression of wars and conflicts?
* What factors contribute to the initiation of conflict?
* Are there early warning indicators of impending conflict?
* Do conflicts exhibit cyclical patterns?
* How do economic factors influence conflict risk?
* Does state diversity increase the likelihood of civil war?
* Is there a link between resource dependence and instability?

**Data**

The project utilized two primary datasets:

* **UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset:** This comprehensive dataset provides details on armed conflicts worldwide since 1960.
* **Enhanced Conflict Dataset:** This dataset builds upon the UCDP/PRIO data by incorporating additional features including GDP, unemployment rates, debt levels, corruption indicators, and demographic information.

**Methodology**

* Data exploration and cleaning
* Feature selection through visualization techniques (including scatter plots and choropleth maps)
* Model building and evaluation (specific models not mentioned here)

**Results**

* **Conflict Types:** Internal conflicts are the most common type faced by countries.
* **Diversity and Civil War:** Contrary to popular belief, variation in religion and ethnicity does not significantly correlate with civil war risk. However, language diversity appears to be a contributing factor.
* **Natural Resource Dependence:** Countries with a high dependence on natural resources (>10%) experience a greater incidence of conflict. 
* **Regional Distribution:** The Middle East, Africa, and Latin America have historically witnessed a higher frequency of conflicts.

**Conclusions**

This project demonstrates the potential of socio-economic factors in predicting conflict risk.  Language diversity and dependence on natural resources emerged as significant factors contributing to internal conflicts. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of various models in predicting future conflicts.

**Future Work**

* Explore additional socio-political factors that might influence conflict risk.
* Develop and evaluate more sophisticated predictive models.
* Integrate findings into early warning systems for conflict prevention.

Please note that the conclusions presented here are based on the specific datasets and methods employed in this project.
